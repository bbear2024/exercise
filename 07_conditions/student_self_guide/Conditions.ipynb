    "# Introduction to if-Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- understand the logic behind if-statement\n",
    "- know the syntax of if-statements (if, elif, else; nested if statements (and or and not))\n",
    "- use comparison operators and define boolean variables\n",
    "- integrate users input with the function input()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to control the flow of your Python program is with an `if` statement. From a high level, an `if` statement allows us to check whether or not a certain condition is true. If it is, certain operations will be performed. Otherwise, those operations will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we're asked to write a program that takes a bunch of numbers and gives back to us those that are even. We would need to write an `if` statement that identifies whether or not a number is even (we'll talk later about how to do this), and then give back only those that meet the even condition. This is a program that will be entirely within our ability to implement at the end of next week; for now, though, let's focus on the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of an `if` statement in Python is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    if_block_statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the `if` statement, after the condition, ends in a colon `:`. This is the way that Python declares the start of an indentation block. The purposes of indentation blocks manifest themselves in many different ways. With our `if` statement, just know that they mark a section of code that is run under specific circumstances, when the codition is true. What does it mean, then, for a condition to be true? To understand this, let's look at conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's tackle this one part at a time. What does it mean to be a condition? Really, all an `if` is checking is whether the conditional evaluates to `True` or `False`. In english, it checks if the condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the body of the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is false, the `if` block is skipped. Intuitively, true and false are concepts that make perfect sense to us. But, we should take the time to clearly define them in a programming context.\n",
    "\n",
    "`True` and `False` are what we call booleans in logic, and what Python calls them (`bool` for short). They are a special variable type with many potential uses; mainly they are used as a way to put a label on the truth of a statement. There are two specifically reserved words for bools in Python, `True` and `False`. Note that these begin with capital letters."

The ones that we will focus on today are the equalities,  *equal to* and *not equal to*, and the inequalities, *less than*, *greater than*, *less than or equal to* and *greater than or equal to*. These comparisons are available in Python via `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`, respectively. Consider the following (in)equality statements.

    "From what we know so far, this functionality isn't super useful. So, let's quickly go over a way that we can make our Python more flexible. Until now, we've had to hard code any variable or value that we want to use in our program. Python has a built in way to accept input from the user of a program. Let's examine this now.

    "Ok, so, the `if` is cool. But, it seems like there are only so many things you can do with it. Let's summarize this with what's known as a *flow diagram*. (If you don't see an image below, make sure that you started this notebook from the folder for the day, not the preclass folder.)\n",

But what if we wanted to check more than one thing (i.e. have more than two branches in our flow diagram)?\n",

    "In addition to the `if`, Python provides us with two other statements to build out those logical trees, the `elif` and the `else`. The `elif` is just like the `if` - it accepts a condition to check the truth of and has an indented code block that is executed when that condition evaluates to `True`. The `else` is similar, but it doesn't accept a condition. Instead, it mainly acts as a catch all for any other situation that you didn't cover with your `if`s and `elif`s. Note that there can only be a single `if` and up to a single `else`, but any number of `elif`s in an `if`-`elif`-`else` block. Let's take a closer look at this in the following code block:"
