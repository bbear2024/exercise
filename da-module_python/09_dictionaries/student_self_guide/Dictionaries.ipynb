However, there are plenty of times when we don't care about order, either because it simply doesn't matter or because the data are associated with each other in a different way. For example, say we have a bunch of state names and we want to associate each state's name with its capital. How would we do this in a list? One way would be to have tuples that store pairs of states and their capitals."

Thus, retrieval of a value from a dictionary is entirely dependent on the key. The consequence of this is that, if we were to use a mutable type as the key for a dictionary and later change what that key looked like, the dictionary wouldn't be able to find the value it was supposed to associate with that key.
