    "Now we're going to push our problem solving and programming skills even further by coding up functions to solve new problems. For each of the problems below, I would suggest coding it up in a similar way to how you did the other two (building the function, and then calling it some number of times (5) to test it out after that). \n",

    "1. Write a function that counts the number of words in an inputted string, where we consider words to be separated by spaces. \n",
    "2. Write a function that counts the number of words in an inputted string, where we consider words to be separated by a specified delimiter (so your function should accept two arguments, one for the string and one for the delimiter) and a space is defined as the default delimiter.  \n",
    "3. Write a function that takes in a string, and returns a list that holds the length of each word in the phrase, separated by an inputted delimiter (so you're function should accept two arguments again). Make a space the default delimiter like you did in `2`. For example, if the arguments to your function were `This is a test string` (and nothing else), your function should return `[4, 2, 1, 4, 6]`. Go ahead and don't worry about removing punctuation (you can include it in the word length - e.g. \"this.\" has five letters, if we count the period). \n",
    "4. Write a function that takes in a list of strings, as well as an inputted letter (which looks like a string with a single character), and returns a list of only those strings from the input list that end with that letter. For example, if I input `['I', 'am', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'Python']` as the list of strings, and `n` as the inputted letter, your function should return `['in', 'Python']`.\n",
