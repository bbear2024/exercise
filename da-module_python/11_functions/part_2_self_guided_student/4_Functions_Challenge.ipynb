Write a function that takes in a string, and returns a list that holds the length of each word in the phrase, separated by an inputted delimiter (so you're function should accept two arguments again). Make a space the default delimiter like you did in `2`. For example, if the arguments to your function were `This is a test string` (and nothing else), your function should return `[4, 2, 1, 4, 6]`. Go ahead and don't worry about removing punctuation (you can include it in the word length - e.g. \"this.\" has five letters, if we count the period). \n",

    "### Extra Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let's build a calculator for figuring out how much I owe in taxes (and by calculator, I mean function). Write a function that takes in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two values, as well as an income to compute the taxes on (so your function should accept two arguments). For the tuple list, the first value of a tuple will be an income upper bound, and the second will be a tax rate for all income up to the given income bound. You need to build a calculator that will calculate the tax for all income up to each income bound (if it goes up that high) for the given tax rate. You can assume that the list of tuples will be sorted by the income bound (e.g. the first value in the tuple), such that the lowest income bound will be first, and the highest last (see below for an example).  \n",
    "\n",
    " As an example, let's say my tax info is `[(50000, 0.08), (100000, 0.10), (150000, 0.15)]`. This means that the first 50k of income is taxed at 8%, the second 50k at 10%, and the rest at 15% (note here that any income that is left past the highest upper bound given is taxed at the rate for that highest upper bound). So, if the inputted income was 70k, then my taxes would be 50 * 0.08 + 20 * 0.10 = 6k. You should write your function to be generalized and accept any kind of list of tuples and any inputted income (so it'll accept two arguments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now modify your solution to `Extra Credit 1` to accept a list of tuples that is not sorted by the income bound. \n",
    "\n",
    " **Hint**: Trying using the `sorted` function and working with the `key` argument (a [lambda](https://www.educative.io/blog/python-lambda-functions-tutorial) function will probably be helpful here). "
