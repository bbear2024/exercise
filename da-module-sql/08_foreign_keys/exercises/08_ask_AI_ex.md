**Q1:** How are Primary Key and Foreign Key involved in a many-to-many relationship?

**Q2:** so the many-to-many relationship always requires at least 3 tables?

...

**Q3:** that means a relationship does not reflect a connection between two tables but rather between logical data which might be spread over multiple tables?

>Exactly, relationships in a database context are about the logical connections between different pieces of data, which can indeed be spread across multiple tables. The physical representation of these relationships through tables is just a means to organize and manage the data efficiently.
>
>In a many-to-many relationship, the connection isnâ€™t directly between the two main tables but is facilitated by a junction table that holds the associations. This allows for a more flexible and scalable design, where the logical relationship is maintained without limiting the number of connections any single piece of data can have.

>So, while the tables are the structural components of the database, the relationships reflect the logical model of how the data interrelates, which can span multiple tables to accurately represent complex real-world interactions among data entities. This approach helps in maintaining data integrity and provides a clear framework for data retrieval and manipulation.

**Q4:** many-to-many relationship could be also created with more than 3 tables?

**Q5:** and is it correct to say that each many-to-many relationship always contains at least two one-to-many relationships ?
