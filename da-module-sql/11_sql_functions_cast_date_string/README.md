#### Additional functions to consider:

​	MAKE_TIME
​	MAKE_INTERVAL (dealing with timestamp was introduced in pandas?)	

​	CASE WHEN (diverse options)
​	IF THEN

#### No exercise for Cast Functions?
-> good idea to add into the existing exercises, so it causes an error and students are forced to type cast first.
-> one really good one that works is when you need to round with average.

#### lecture strings with tables
-> not highest priority but it would be really nice to have the lecture with tables (life expectancy or airports, flights)
