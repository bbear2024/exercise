    "For this assignment you'll use functions to build a guessing game. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be prompted to build small functions that make up the individual components of the game and then build a function to put them all together into a game that you can play.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, pretend all of the following is the solution to one of the problems, written in a function first and then called (for testing purposes) below. \n",

    "```python \n",
    "# Write the function to get the players name\n",
    "def get_player_name(): \n",
    "    # Function code to solve the problem\n",
    "    return player_name\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write the function that does something\n",
    "def exciting_game_content(player_name):\n",
    "    # some stuff happens\n",
    "    return outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write the code that brings the functions together\n",

    "    print(\"Welcome to the game!)\n",

    "### Pseudocode (Description of the solution without writing real code)\n",

    "Set the parameters of the game at the start:  \n",
    "    User says how many turns they want to guess before they lose. Nice to have: have ability to select an unlimited game.  \n",
    "    User determines the range of numbers from which the computer will select.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly select an integer from a specified range and store in memory.  \n",
    "The user is asked to guess what the integer is.  \n",
    "If the inputted guess matches the number in memory the user wins!  \n",
    "Else the user is told whether the guess was too low or too high  \n",
    "    and the user is asked again to make a guess.  \n",
    "This continues in a loop until the user guesses correctly or the number of guesses is exhausted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Extra Credit Extensions:  \n",
    "1. The game can operate on easy mode where the history of guesses and responses are printed or on hard mode where the screen is cleared after each guess and the user is not reminded of their previous guesses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. There can be a hint function that gives the user the best next number to guess based on performing a \"binary search algorithm\". In the binary search the next guess should be the one in the middle of problem space. So from a range of 0 to 10 the best guess is 5 because in the event of a wrong guess the resulting problem space is guaranteed to be minimized no matter if the guess was too low or too high.\n"
