    "For these exercises you'll be working through solving more problems, but this time by building functions from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each problem, you should build a function into your solution. We will build each function into it's own cell, and then call it with some arguments in the next cell right after you define it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, pretend all of the following is the solution to one of the problems, written in a function first and then called (for testing purposes) below. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def my_func(param1, param2, param3): \n",
    "    # Function code to solve the problem\n",

    "print(my_func(param11, param21, param31))\n",

    "print(my_func(param14, param24, param34))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note above that `my_func` is called five times after it's definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tests should check that `my_func` works correctly with different sets of arguments. You should aim to test your functions at least 5 times after you write them. It's good to try to think of tests that your function might not solve correctly (we call these **edge cases**). Not only does thinking like this help you solve the problem, but it also gives you more faith in your solution.\n"
